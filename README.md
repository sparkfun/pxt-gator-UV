## Basic usage

```blocks
//Initializes the sensor to prepare it for readings.
gatorUV.begin()
```

Use ``||initialize gator:UV sensor||`` to prepare the gator:UV to take readings.

```blocks
//Grabs a value from the sensor and writes it out over serial
serial.writeNumber(gatorUV.UV())
```

Use ``||serial write number ||get UVA Reading|| ||`` To grab a UVA reading from the sensor and write it out over serial.

```blocks
//Changes the integration time for our sensor
gatorUV.setRefreshTime(gatorUVRefreshTime.one)
```

Use ``||set refresh time on UV Sensor to **one**||`` to change the time over which a reading is taken on the UV sensor

## Example: Light Detector

```blocks
//Read UV value and write it to the serial port
gatorUV.begin()
basic.forever(function () {
    serial.writeNumber(gatorUV.UV())
})
```
